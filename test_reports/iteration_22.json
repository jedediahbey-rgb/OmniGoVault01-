The main agent has partially implemented the refactoring to move 'Edit' functionality into 3-dot dropdown menus for consistency. MeetingEditorPage is fully refactored and matches the goal, but DistributionEditorPage and InsuranceEditorPage still have Finalize and Amend buttons as separate buttons outside the dropdown, which is inconsistent with the refactoring objective.",
